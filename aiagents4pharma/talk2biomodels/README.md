**Talk2BioModels** is an AI agent designed to facilitate interaction with mathematical models in systems biology. Systems biology models are critical in understanding complex biological mechanisms, but theyâ€™re often inaccessible to those without coding or mathematical expertise. Talk2BioModels simplifies this, enabling researchers to focus on analysis and interpretation rather than on programming. With Talk2BioModels, users can interact directly with these models through natural language. By simply asking questions or making requests, users can:

- Forward simulation of both internal and open-source models (BioModels).
- Adjust parameters within the model to simulate different conditions.
- Query simulation results.
