Welcome to **AIAgents4Pharma** â€“ an open-source project by [Team VPE](https://github.com/VirtualPatientEngine) that brings together AI-driven tools to help researchers and pharma interact seamlessly with complex biological data.

Our toolkit currently consists of three intelligent agents, each designed to simplify and enhance access to specialized data in biology:

- [**Talk2BioModels**](talk2biomodels/models/intro.md): Engage directly with mathematical models in systems biology.

- [**Talk2Cells**](talk2cells/intro.md) *(Coming soon)*: Query and analyze sequencing data with ease.

- [**Talk2KnowledgeGraphs**](Talk2KnowledgeGraphs/intro.md) *(Coming soon)*: Access and explore complex biological knowledge graphs for insightful data connections.
